  "disclaimer": "Time-based daily drop-in billing: Brightwheel automatically tracks each child’s attendance based on their clock-in and clock-out times. Charges for drop-in care are calculated directly from this time log:\n\nAny day with up to 4 hours of care is billed at $30 per day.\n\nAny day with over 4 hours of care is billed at $60 per day.\n\nBrightwheel applies these drop-in rates automatically, generates the daily totals, and includes them in your monthly invoice. This means all billing is handled directly by Brightwheel’s system—staff do not adjust or override times. Before- and after-school drop-in care is included in this same time-based structure."
